SDCC Binary Kit Install Help
----------------------------

For Linux users:
================
To install:

* Extract the binary kit to a temporary directory.
  This will create a new directory called 'sdcc' in the temporary directory.
    cd ~
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    tar xzf path/to/binary/kit/sdcc-2.7.2-i386-unknown-linux2.5.tar.gz

* Change to the sdcc directory and copy all files to /usr/local
    cd sdcc
    cp -r * /usr/local

This will install sdcc binaries into: /usr/local/bin/
header files into:                    /usr/local/share/sdcc/include/
library files into:                   /usr/local/share/sdcc/lib/
and documentation into:               /usr/local/share/sdcc/doc/

You can test the install by entering:
    /usr/local/bin/sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

Even if the default search paths look into /usr/local, sdcc is fully
relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you have problems with header
or library files. See sdccman.[txt|pdf|html] for more detailed information.


For Windows 9X/NT/2000/XP users:
================================
To install:

* If you would like to keep a copy of your previous version,
  rename the directory where it's installed first
* Run sdcc-2.7.2-setup.exe

By default this will install sdcc binaries into: C:\Program Files\SDCC\bin\
header files into:                               C:\Program Files\SDCC\include\
library files into:                              C:\Program Files\SDCC\lib\
and documentation into:                          C:\Program Files\SDCC\doc\

You can test the install by opening a DOS box and entering:
    sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

sdcc for win32 is fully relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you
have problems with header or library files. See sdccman.[txt|pdf|html] for
more detailed information.


For Mac OS X users:
===================
To install:

* Extract the binary kit to a temporary directory.
  This will create a new directory called 'sdcc' in the temporary directory.
    cd ~
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    tar xzf path/to/binary/kit/sdcc-2.7.2-ppc-apple-macosx.tar.gz

* Change to the sdcc directory and copy all files to /Developer/sdcc
    cp -r sdcc /Developer/sdcc

This will install sdcc binaries into: /Developer/sdcc/bin/
header files into:                    /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/include/
library files into:                   /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/lib/
and documentation into:               /Developer/sdcc/share/sdcc/doc/

You can test the install by entering:
    /Developer/sdcc/bin/sdcc -v

This should return sdcc's version number.

Even if the default search paths look into /usr/local, sdcc is fully
relocatable. Try `sdcc --print-search-dirs` if you have problems with header
or library files. See sdccman.[txt|pdf|html] for more detailed information.
