Welcome to SDCC, free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C compiler
that supports a growing list of processors including the Intel mcs51
family, the Zilog z80, the Maxim ds390 and the Motorola HC08.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.
